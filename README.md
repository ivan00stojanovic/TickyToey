A pair programming project made by [@ivan00stojanovic](https://github.com/ivan00stojanovic) and [@meghannfh](https://github.com/meghannfh)
to revise our front end skills while also  experiencing coding in a team setting.

# Tech stack

Tech used: HTML, CSS & JS

# Optimizations

While the project is consider finished, we are planning to implement a reset button which would allow the user to reset the game while it is in place and clear the table,
to make the user expirience as easier as possible.
